Improved Caesar cipher:
- Asks the user for one line of text to encrypt;
- Asks the user for a shift value (an integer number from the range 1..25 - note: you should force the user to enter a valid shift value;

## 08_find_a_word.py
Write a program which answers the following question: are the characters comprising the first string hidden inside the second string?

## 09_sudoku.py

- Reads 9 rows of the Sudoku, each containing 9 digits (check carefully if the data entered are valid);
- Outputs Yes if the Sudoku is valid, and No otherwise.
    
## 10_character_frequency_histogram.py
Write a program which:
- Asks the user for the input file's name;
- Reads the file (if possible) and counts all the Latin letters (lower- and upper-case letters are treated as equal);
- Prints a simple histogram in alphabetical order (only non-zero counts should be presented).
    
## 11_evaluating_students_results.py
Write a program which:
